      "\n",
      "Mumbai: Tata Motors' big demerger plan is finally wrapping up, and it's a pretty major shakeup for the company. They've just renamed their commercial vehicles arm -- what used to be TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd is now officially Tata Motors Ltd. This change got the green light from regulators, and they made it official with a new Certificate of Incorporation on October 29, 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier in this whole process, the main Tata Motors Ltd also got a new name -- now it's Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), as of October 13, 2025. The whole idea behind this restructuring is to split the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle businesses into two completely separate companies. Each one gets to focus on what it does best and chase its own growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demerger kicked in on October 1, 2025, and the record date was October 14. If you were a shareholder on that day, you got one share of Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV) for every Tata Motors Ltd share you held. So now investors have stakes in both the commercial and passenger vehicle businesses. The plan's pretty straightforward -- make sure nobody loses out and keep things smooth for shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what's next for these two businesses? Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd takes on the passenger car and electric vehicle side, including the fast-growing Tata.ev lineup. The new Tata Motors Ltd, on the other hand, will focus only on commercial vehicles -- trucks, buses, and fleet solutions. Analysts say splitting the company like this gives both sides a sharper focus and a better shot at growing value for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the stock: after the demerger, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd debuted at Rs 400 a share on the NSE on October 14. That's down from the pre-demerger closing price of Rs 660.75. So, by the numbers, the commercial vehicle business -- now Tata Motors Ltd -- holds a residual value of about Rs 260.75 a share. Investors are waiting for the new Tata Motors Ltd to list in November, which should finally show how the market values the commercial vehicle business on its own.\n",

      "Mumbai, Nov 12 (PTI) The commercial vehicle demand has \"done well\" after the GST rate rationalisation with the market picking up in the September quarter following a drop in the April-June period of the fiscal year, Girish Wagh, Managing Director and CEO of Tata Motors Ltd, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wagh also said the listing of the commercial vehicle business will enable the company to have a good sharper strategic focus on the overall CV and logistics value chain and look for opportunities within that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, shares of Tata Motors commercial vehicle business now known as Tata Motors, got listed on the bourses following the demerger of the CV business from the passenger vehicle business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The merger took effect from October 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think first half of the year has been largely flat but with nuances, in the first quarter, one had seen a drop, but in Q2 the market has picked up, especially I must say that post the GST rate rationalisation the demand has done well, one has seen impacts of GST rate rationalisation,\" Wagh told PTI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have also seen a secondary impact, which is due to overall consumption growth, the freight being transported on road is going up which has led to higher utilisation of trucks and therefore fleet owners are going for more numbers of heavy-duty long-haul trucks,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expecting a \"far better\" second half than the first, he said the products are absolutely the heart of the company's business while it continues launching new products.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the listing will also strengthen the governance, which Tata Motors is known for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stating that the just-listed entity should be looking at good value creation in this (EV) business, he said, \"In the light and small commercial vehicles category, we already have two products and with the recent launch of Ace Pro electric, I think we are seeing a significant pull because of the vehicle being lowest priced four wheeled EV in the country and therefore we are seeing significant pull for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will also see a lot of action happening from the company on electrification in medium and heavy-duty trucks also, we have been working on that. In addition to that, we have also been working on some advanced technology projects, including hydrogen,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the listing ceremony, he said the trading of the company's shares on the bourses is a \"moment of renewal, of sharper focus and of bold ambition that will reshape the future of mobility\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tata Motors commercial vehicle business has long powered India's industrial progress and is now poised to lead global logistics and sustainable mobility,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last few years, the company has driven structural shifts within the business, which have yielded results in the form of strong margin growth, robust cash flows and high return on capital employment while pivoting decisively towards digital and sustainability, Wagh said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here on, we will accelerate our efforts to build a company that is financially fit, delivering profitable growth, a company that is leveraging digital and technology to enhance customer value, ecosystem integration and operational efficiency,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Internationally, we are scaling with deeper partnerships and expanding footprints across Africa, the Middle East and Asia,\" he added. PTI IAS TRB\n",

      "\n",
      "New Delhi, November 12: Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran on Wednesday said that the demerger of Tata Motors' commercial and passenger vehicle businesses marks a major milestone, allowing both entities to pursue independent growth strategies after years of shared financial interdependence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the listing ceremony of the commercial vehicle division, Chandrasekaran said that there was always support for Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) from the performance of Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles (TMCV). He added that cash flows were coming from commercial vehicles and were subsumed in the capital expenditure of the passenger vehicle segment.

      "\n",
      "The separation was essential to ensure both businesses were \"fit\" and \"directionally strong\", he further added. The idea of demerging the two divisions was first conceived in 2017-18, but the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the plan. It was later revived and gained momentum over the last couple of years, culminating in the official demerger earlier this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chandrasekaran noted that TMCV had consistently remained profitable, while TMPV had faced financial challenges in the past. \"It was clear to me 8-9 years ago that this company had to have a different path. Before splitting the company, it had to be made ready,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shares of Tata Motors' commercial vehicle business made a strong debut on the stock exchanges on Wednesday, listing at Rs 335 per share on NSE, up 28 per cent over the discovered price of Rs 260.75. The commercial vehicle company kept the Tata Motors name (TML) after the split, but the passenger vehicle division was renamed Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPVL).

      "TMPV, which is already listed, owns a portion of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and includes Tata Motors' electric and passenger vehicle businesses. In July 2025, Tata Motors revealed its intention to pay 3.8 billion euros to acquire the Italian commercial vehicle giant Iveco Group. This would be the company's largest acquisition to date and the second-largest in the history of the Tata Group.
